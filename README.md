I'm an [Offroad Engineer](https://tashian.com/articles/offroad-engineering/) at [Smallstep](https://smallstep.com), helping to make Public Key Infrastructure easier to understand and use.
I write about technology on [my website](https://tashian.com). Most recently I wrote [CLI Guidelines](https://clig.dev/), an [open-source guide](https://github.com/cli-guidelines/cli-guidelines) to help you write better command-line programs.
