I'm an Offroad Engineer at [Smallstep](https://smallstep.com), helping to make modern PKI easy to understand and use.
I write about technology on [my website](https://tashian.com). Most recently I wrote [CLI Guidelines](https://clig.dev/), an [open-source guide](https://github.com/cli-guidelines/cli-guidelines) to help you write better command-line programs.
